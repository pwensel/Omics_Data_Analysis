#EXERCISE 1.1: Summarize in your own words the biological background as per described in Pristner M, et al. 

Part 1 answers are based on scientific evidence cited from the relevent publication:
"Neuroactive metabolites and bile acids are altered in extremely premature infants with brain injury"
Manuel Pristner, Daniel Wasinger, David Seki, Katrin Kleberma√ü-Schrehof, Angelika Berger, David Berry, Lukas Wisgrill, Benedikt Warth
medRxiv 2023.05.17.23290088; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.17.23290088
Now published in Cell Reports Medicine doi: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2024.101480

The experimental design and biological background is as follows: 
The gut microbiome is associated with pathological neurophysiological evolvement in extremely premature infants suffering from brain injury. To elucidate the early-life biological phenomeno involved,the plasma and fecal metabolome of a cohort of 51 extremely premature infants with brain injury and the correlation with gut microbiome and immunological data was studied via liquid chromatography (LC)-high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted metabolomics  and LC-MS/MS-based targeted analysis. For our specific analysis, 75 fecal samples that were collected at 3 different time points (i.e. 7 days, 28 days, and term_age) were analyzed, along with 34 QC samples, using hydrophillic chromatography-negative ion mode ESI MS and MS/MS.An early onset of differentiation in neuroactive metabolites between infants with and without brain injury and several bacterially derived bile acid amino acid conjugates in plasma and feces were detected. 

#EXERCISE 1.2: What type of metabolomic approaches were used to analyse the fecal samples? Were they untargeted or a targeted? 

Both targeted and untargeted approaches were used to analyze fecal samples.Targeted metabolomics applies methods that have been optimized to quantify a defined set of molecules, and such approach is well suited for research questions that require measuring all of a small number of analytes in a sample (e.g., does this drug affect a specific pathway of interest? do these samples contain a given pesticide? is this compound a marker for a particular phenotype?). Targeted metabolomics apply tandem mass spectrometers like triple quadrupoles (QqQ)to quantitate less than a few dozen compounds, but some workflows have been developed to monitor several hundred metabolites.

#EXERCISE 1.3: For the untargeted analysis, what type of chromatography was used? Was it normal and/or reverse phase? 

For untargeted analysis, both (normal) Hydrophillic and (relatively more hydrophobic) reverse-phase chromatography were used
Two columns, a HILIC column(SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC; 5um, 150x2.1mm) and a RP column (Waters Acquity HSST3; 1.8um,100x2.1mm) were used for complementary and broad coverage of analytes.

#EXERCISE 1.4: What type of MS-instrument was used in either case? 

For untargeted metabolomics:VAnquish UHPLC system coupled to a QExactive HF quadrupole-Orbitrap(Thermo) mass spectrometer
via an ESI interface was used. For targeted metabolomic, TSQ Vantage Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo) via an ESI interface was used
This is later confirmed below via the following code: 
mbank_sub[2]$instrument
[1] "LTQ Orbitrap XL, Thermo Scientfic; HP-1100 HPLC, Agilent"

#EXERCISE 1.5 What type of ionization and ionization modes were used? 

Electro-spray ionionization (ESI) was used and negative ionization mode (polarity=0) were used.
Later Confirm polarity used for acquisition:
polarities <- table(mz.conditions$polarity)
head(polarities)
0-negative, 1-positive, -1=unkown
0L for negative polarity, 1L for positive polarity

31, 4, 13, 11, 8, 8, and 34 replicates measured for each time point or QC. This was determined and confirmed by by the following rationale and code:

#EXERCISE 2.3: Plot total ion chromatograms for all samples and color-code them according to different fecal collection time points. 

Please refer to Figure 1 and associated rationale and code below:
```{r cars4}
#The chromatogram() method returns a MChromatograms object that organizes individual Chromatogram objects containing the chromatographic data 
#in a 2-D array: columns represent samples and rows (optionally) m/z and/or retention time ranges. To create a total ion chromatogram aggregationFun is set to "sum", and for the base peak chromatogram (BPC) 
#for each file in our experiment, aggregationFun is set to "max" to return for each spectrum the maximal intensity and hence create the BPC from the raw data. )

TICs <- chromatogram(raw_data, aggregationFun = "sum") 
# Plot according to experimental groups of different fecal collection time points
group_colors <- brewer.pal(7, "Dark2")[1:length(levels(pData(raw_data)$class))]
names(group_colors) <- levels(pData(raw_data)$class)
plot(TICs, col = group_colors[raw_data$class], main = "TIC")
#FIGURE 1

#Most peaks are eluted early at < 230 seconds, suggesting need to explore appropriate chromatography column resins
#Due to the complexity of chemical matrices, short chromatographic times, and poor LC/MS chromatographic resolution, 
#TIC usually represents an envelop of metabolites overlap. Thus, TICs only allows an overview of the technical measurements 
#performance with no inferred biological insights.

#Comparing TIC intensities from samples entering study to identify potential technical outliers:
tc <- split(tic(raw_data), f = fromFile(raw_data))
boxplot(tc, col = group_colors[raw_data$class],ylab = "intensity", names = row.names(pheno),main = "Total ion current")
#FIGURE 2

#Evidently , the initial QC samples 1-9, 22, 29 are outliers with no detected ion current. I will not later include these
#in subset of QC samples for xcms retention time alignment step.
```
#EXERCISE 2.4:Extract Tryptophan ion chromatogram ([M-H]-) (hint: retention time ~ 2.99 minutes). 
#Which sample does apparently hold higher levels of Tryptophan?. Plot the extracted ion chromatogram for this sample.
#Can you confirm this peak being Tryptophan from MS1 data? Please refer to Figure for the extracted trypophan ion chromatogram.

Using two different approaches, the sample apparently holding higher levels of tryptophan was determined to be either 
CTR_day28 sample with file index 3 and sample file ID 034_ID_18.mzM(more likely) or 
CTR_day7 sample with file index 32 and sample file ID 027_ID_2.mzML (highest base peak intensity)
I cannot confirm that this peak is tryptophan from MS1 data. Only elemental composition can be inferred.
I infer formula for element composition from intact ion but MS2 fragmentation is needed to elucidate and determining molecular structure 
for ultimate identification with higher-level certainty.Although the precursor m/z of our MS1 spectra matches the m/z of tryptophan, until we examine further as in Exercise 2.5, we can still not exclude that their MS/MS (MS2) spectra represent fragments of ions from different compounds (with the same m/z than tryptophan).Please refer to code below for rationale:
```{r cars5}

#EXERCISE 2.5 Read MS/MS spectrum for Tryptophan from samples in MS/MS (acquired in HILIC ESI(-), [M-H]- ) and compare to those 
#MS/MS spectra tabulated on public libraries. Compute similarity scores and comment on it. Which level of ID would you 
#be obtaining with these empirical data? Reason your responses. Do the same for uracil and aspartic acid. 

In addition to high-scoring matches between my empirical tryptophan MS/MS spectra and those of NIST, MassBank, and HMDB, 
the authors in their scientific publication "observed metabolic changes at the pathway level Enriched metabolic pathways and their combined p values for (A) plasma, (B) feces, and (C) their intersection.logfold increase change of tryptophan observed in feces termage but not detected in 7 and 28 days".The Authors also observe "significant alterations between groups, including uracil (ICL = 1, p = 0.041,FC-log2 = 3.4) on day 7 feces. Furthermore, the authors observed "significant negative correlations with the neurotransmitter GABA (ICL = 1)
and N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (ICL = 1), the precursor of the neuronal dipeptide N-acetylaspartylglutamate, and  N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (ICL = 1) 
was correlated with Enterococcus". As explained below in greater detail, based on (1) the authors' observations in their peer-reviewed scientific publication, (2) high MS/MS spectral matches (93.4% similarity score) and similiar intensity distributions between those of my empirical spectra and 
those from with those of NIST, HMDB, and MassBank (93.4% similarity score), and (3) previously demonstrated correspondence with XIC pre-cursor MS1 ion chromotagram peak, I conclude with level 2 certainty that the previous MS1 pre-cursor chromatogram peak represented elemental composition of tryptophan and that the corresponding MS2 spectra represents all the major MS2 fragments that confirm the structure and identity of tryptophan in the fecal samples. I have lower level of certainty for L-aspartic acid (35% similarity score with MassBank spectra), and even lower level-certainty for uracil due to extremely low similarity scores against MassBank MS spectral library. These low scores are potentially attributed to inappropriate selection of retention time width as explained before, my varied and inconsistent use of different ppm values for the compareSpectra and filterPrecursorMzValues() methods, differences in collision energies and/or Mass Spectrometer instrumentation, batch-effects, procedures, and other conditions. THis can also be attributed to the uncertainty around the negative or positive nature of ionization of acids like L-aspartic acid.Please refer to approach and code writtn below for this comparison of spectra:

#Level 2: Putatively annotated structure; As for levels 3 and 4, including spectral similarity with public or commercial libraries

#EXERCISE 3: Run a full XCMS analysis for HILIC negative ionization mode. Stick to xcms parameters defined by authors.

#EXERCISE 3.1 Explain in your own words each one of the steps in the xcms workflow. Which is the rationale of performing different chromatographies 
#and using different ionization modes? 

Ionization dictates the type of mass spectrum.Different metabolites ionize differently an /or more efficeintly, and this is why both negative and positive ionization modes should be performed for MS. Different metabolites derived from different cellular environments (i.e. hydropphoc membranes vs. soluble proteins in aqueous cytoplasm) will also separate differently from mixtures of other metabolites, and therefore appropriate Higher resolution separation can be achieved by targeting chromatographic technique to more differentiable and unique separation properties of metabolite (i.e. hydrophobicity via Reverse-Phase (RP-HPLC) or hydrophobic interaction (HI)resin, size or molecular weighted via size-exclusion chromatogaphy resin, strong negative charge via anion-exchange chromatography, strong positive charge via cation exchange chromatogrphy, strong affinity via streptavaid or 6x-polyhistidine affinity chromatography resins, etc. The following code below implements the xcms process:

```{r cars7}
#XCMS

#XCMS STEP1: 
#Chromatographic peak detection is performed on extracted ion chromatograms, which helps testing and tuning peak detection settings. 
#Running centWave chromatographic peak detection on tryptophan peak using recommended publication authors parameters (not Scripps on-line xcms or default) 
#Centwave parameters. Running centWave algorithm on EICs implies different background signal estimation since less data is available.
#Thus, different settings for snthresh are needed (generally a lower snthresh will be used for EICs since the estimated background 
#signal tends to be higher for data subsets than for the full data):

#XCMS STEP 2: ALIGNMENT

#The time at which analytes elute from the chromatographic column (rt) can vary between samples (and even compounds). 
#The alignment step (retention time correction) adjusts for these differences by shifting signals 
#along the retention time axis and aligning them between different samples within an experiment

#Aim: adjust shifts in retention times between samples.
#Function: adjustRtime.
#Available methods:
#obiwarp (ObiwarpParam) (Prince and Marcotte 2006): warps the (full) data to a reference sample.
#peakGroups (PeakGroupsParam) (Smith et al. 2006): align spectra from different samples based on hook peaks. 
#Need to define the hook peaks first: peaks present in most/all samples.
#We here align samples using obiwarp with authors (not online) xcms parameters

#According to authors' cited publication: "The retention time between samples were aligned employing the obiwarp algorithm 
#(parameters: binSize = 0.6, distFun = "cor_opt") with a previous alignment of pooled QC samples followed by the alignment of the samples". 

#Defining author-specified settings for the alignment (initially with no subset of QC samples):
#xdata_adj <- adjustRtime(xdata, param = ObiwarpParam(binSize = 0.6, distFun = "cor_opt")

#Executing this code unfortunately generated the following error using default system centerSample=55
#Stop worker failed with the error: wrong args for environment subassignment
#Error: BiocParallel errors

#I  specify a subset of QC samples that based on boxplot of total ion current looked OK and not as outliers, as well as use subset adjust=previous as 
#authors mention QC samples adjustment preceded those of regular samples:
#For some experiments it might be better to perform the alignment based on only a subset of the available samples, 
#e.g. if pooled QC samples were injected at regular intervals or if the experiment contains blanks. 
#All alignment methods in xcms support such a subset-based alignment in which retention time shifts are estimated on
#only a specified subset of samples followed by an alignment of the whole data set based on the aligned subset.
#The subset of samples for such an alignment can be specified with the parameter subset of the PeakGroupsParam or ObiwarpParam object
#Parameter subsetAdjust allows to specify the method by which the left-out samples will be adjusted. There are currently two options available:
#subsetAdjust = "previous": adjust the retention times of a non-subset sample based on the alignment results of the previous subset sample (e.g. a QC sample).
#This approach requires a meaningful/correct ordering of the samples within the object (i.e., samples should be ordered by injection index).

#XCMS Step 3: xcms Correspondence
#Correspondence is usually the final step in LC-MS data pre-processing in which data, presumably representing signal 
#from the same originating ions, is matched across samples

#Aim: group signal (peaks) from the same ion across samples.
#Function: groupChromPeaks.
#Methods available:
#peak density (PeakDensityParam) (Smith et al. 2006).
#nearest (NearestPeaksParam)

#Iterate through slices along m/z. Within these small slices along the m/z dimension, the algorithm combines 
#chromatographic peaks depending on the density of these peaks along the retention time axis: i.e., 
#it compares retention times of peaks within each slice and group peaks if they are close.Distribution of peaks along retention time axis 
#is used to define those peaks to group. plotChromPeakDensity: plot distribution of identified peaks along rt for a given m/z slice; 
#simulates correspondence analysis.

#Peak density parameters:
#bw is the most important parameter. It defines the smoothness of the density function
#binSize: m/z width of the data slice in which peaks are grouped. It should be small enough to avoid peaks 
#from different ions measured at similar retention times to be grouped together
#maxFeatures: maximum number of features to be defined in one bin.
#minFraction: minimum proportion of samples (of one group!) for which a peak has to be present.
#minSamples: minimum number of samples a peak has to be present.
#Set on-line xcms parameters for peak density using PeakDensityParam

#According to cited publication's authors: The detected peaks were grouped to features with a minimum threshold 
#of 40% in at least one experimental group (parameters: bw = 1, minFraction = 0.4, minSamples = 5). 
#Features missing a peak in certain samples were integrated in the respective retention time width of the feature. The resulting 
#feature list was further processed by the R package CAMERA (1.48)81 (parameters: perfwhm = 0.6, ppm = 5),

#Evidently, there are several missing values in this feature matrix. Peak detection may have failed in one sample, resulting in  Peak feature matrix returning NA values.
#Ion is not present in a sample. Missing values are reported if in one sample no chromatographic peak was detected 
#in the m/z - rt region of the feature. This does however not necessarily mean that there is no signal for that specific ion in that sample. 
#The chromatographic peak detection algorithm could also just have failed to identify any peak in that region, 
#e.g. because the signal was too noisy or too low. Thus after correspondence, it is recommended to perform a gap-filling step 
#to handle missing values and avoid sparse matrices for subsequent statistical analysis.

#fillChromPeaks allows to fill-in signal for missing peaks from the feature area (defined by the median rt and mz of all peaks assigned to the feature). 
#Data to fill-in are retrieved from original mzML files
#fillChromPeaks Parameters:
#expandMz, expandRt: expands the region from which signal is integrated in m/z or rt dimension. 
#A value of 0 means no expansion, 1 means the region is grown by half of the feature‚Äôs m/z width on both sides.
#ppm: expand the m/z width by a m/z dependent value.
#Fill in missing values and compare the number of missing values before and after doing it.

#EXERCISE 4.1.1 Use your feature matrix to reproduce the statistical analysis performed by authors as they state in the pre-print:
#Do you get to the same PCA conclusions as in Figure 1B? 

Figure 1B depicts PCA and Boxplots of the distance to the centroid of the combined (RP+HILIC/Negative+ Positive Polarity)data obtained from the untargeted  LC-HRMS experiments of all sampling time points of fecal samples t proved experimental overview. Generally, the metabolome of the pathological and the control CTR PAT group exhibited no group-specific clustering in the PCA, neither in the plasma nor in the feces. However,  there was clearly clustering between sampling time points, as seen in plasma and, in our specific feces samples.Time point was a significant, while group affiliation was not deemed significant (p<0.001). Individual factors dominated differences in metabolome between patients (PATIENT ID). Average euclidean. In fecal samples, slightly tighter clustering was shown at Day 28 along with a tendency to spread out at term equivalent age, indicating a diversification of the gut metabolome over time and possibly also the gut microbiome.

Less variance (15.54% +4.24%=19.78%) was evidently captured by my first 2 PCA components compared to (25.75%+7.13%=32.88%) prior to removal of QC class samples. Unlike the authors' Figure 1B, for fecal samples, there does not appear to be clustering around sampling time (7days, 28days, termage) but there is clustering for QC class before it was removed as a variable.The approach taken for this involved following filtering criteria and explotaroty data analysis described below:    
```{r cars8}
#Filtering criteria
#1.Samples representation in each feature: Retain just those features consistently found across i.e., 80% samples in at least one experimental group
#2.Minimum intensity threshold: Filter out those features below a certain intensity threshold. To ensure recording suitable MS/MS spectra for ID purposes parent 
#ions should present a minimum intensity
#3.Analytical variability: Features should enclose more biological variability than analytical variability. Analytical variability is computed 
#using QC samples, i.e., a pool of each individual sample entering the study and periodically analyzed along the worklist. 
#Filter out those features with more analytical than biological variability
#4.Statistical Criteria: Retain those features enclosing significant variation according to our experimental design
#5.Library hits: Retain only mzRT returning a MS1 match with a library compound (i.e, HMDB)

#EXERCISE 4.1.2: Reproduce Figure 3F for Tryptophan for HILIC ESI(-) conditions. How do their levels compare to those from their metabolites? 
#Is there any rationale?

Figure 3F depicts boxplot of several tryptophan metabolites with altered abundance between experimental groups in plasma and feces.
The tryptophan metabolites to be displayed are INDOLELACTIC ACID, TRYPTAMINE, 5-HYDROXYINDOLE.According to the authors, tryptamine, also a 
neuroactive TRP metabolite, was positively correlated with Enterococcus, while indole, the neuroactive TRP metabolite, was negatively correlated with Staphylococcus".Therefore, we will retrieving MS1 putative hits using HMDB for these three metabolites as follows:
```{r cars9}
#A simple matching of feature m/z values against theoretical m/z values is in HMDB performed through MetaboAnnotation package. 
#This package, defines high-level user functionality to support and facilitate annotation of MS-based metabolomics data.
#As a result, we obtain MS1 putative annotation of features. This is the lowest level of confidence in metabolite annotation. 
#However, it gives ideas about potential metabolites that can be analyzed in further downstream experiments and analyses
#To keep the runtime of this tutorial short, MS1 match is done after feature filtering. However, MS1 annotation can be done before 
#any filter is performed. This should eventually help to better control false positives during statistical comparison.
#First, we define the target compounds database (HMDB) in which we have only the monoisotopic mass available for each entry. 
#We need to convert this monoisotopic mass to m/z values in order to match the m/z values from the features (i.e. the query m/z values) 
#against them. For this we need to define the most likely ions/adducts that would be generated from the compounds based on the ionization 
#mode used in the experiment. We assume the most abundant adducts from the compounds being ‚Äú[M+H]+‚Äù. Notice that you can get a full list of
#supported adducts the MetaboCoreUtils::adductNames(polarity = "positive") function can be used.

#' Load HMDB as target database 
HMDB_t <-  readRDS(file = "C:/Users/User/Desktop/R/Metabolomics/Metabolomics/HMDB_t.rds")
#' Select plausible adducts according to polarity
adducts_negative <- MetaboCoreUtils::adductNames(polarity = "negative")[c(13,16,18,20,36,38)]

#' Select the query data
DF2ID <- cbind.data.frame(feature.info[rownames(RES.sig),], RES.sig)
DF2ID$features_id <- rownames(DF2ID)
DF2ID$mz <- DF2ID$mzmed

#We next perform the matching with the matchValues function providing the query and target data 
#as well as a parameter object (in our case a Mass2MzParam) with the settings for the matching. 
#With this Mass2MzParam, the monoisotopic mass of target compounds in the data base get first converted 
#to m/z values, based on the defined adducts, and these are then matched against the query m/z values 
#(i.e. the m/z values for the features).

#' Define parameters to perform the search
#' Use only [M-H] adduct
parmH <- Mass2MzParam(adducts = adducts_negative[1],tolerance = 0.005, ppm = 20)
#' Match values
matched_featuresH <- matchValues(query = DF2ID, target = HMDB_t , param = parmH)
#' Explore and interpret results 
matched_featuresH

#From the 16 features in the query 3 are matched against at least one target compound in the HMDB_t dataframe 
#(all matches are against a single compound).
#matchedData returns a DataFrame with all rows in query and their corresponding matches 
#in target along with the matching adduct (column "adduct") and the difference in m/z 
#(colum "score" for absolute differences and "ppm_error" for the m/z relative differences). 
#Note that if a row in query matches multiple elements in target, this row will be duplicated 
#in the DataFrame returned by data. For rows that can not be matched NA values are reported.

##EXERCISE 4.2:

#EXERCISE 4.2.1:Why do to think authors solely use protonated/deprotonated adducts?

"The most important qualitative rule to predict which fragment will retain the charge and how abundant will be in the spectrum is 
to investigate the proton affinity of their neutral counterparts.Field‚Äôs rule states that the higher is the proton affinity of a neutral, 
the higher is the intensity of its charged form in the spectrum. There is much less information on the fragmentation processes of deprotonated molecules in the literature partly because the formation of deprotonated molecules is usually limited to compounds possessing acidic protons (the bile acids and L-aspartic acid of our study)or compounds that could generate such ones by tautomerism. Other reasons include the poor understanding of fragmentation processes and technical difficulties. The signal intensity for ES‚àí is usually lower, therefore whenever possible, use of ES+ is recommended. However, ES‚àí is of high importance e.g., for the characterization of flavonoids, oligosaccharides, carboxylic acids, 
sulfonamides, oligonucleotides and rarely peptides. For a more comprehensive characterization, additional types of fragmentation can be explored: 
For exammple, the fragmentation characteristics of an [M + zH]z+ type protonated molecule (even-electron pre-cursor) and an M+ radical type molecular ion(odd-electro precursor) is significantly different. OE ions tend to fragment at more random sites, while even-electron ions usually produce less but more stable fragments by cleavages at the thermochemically least stable bonds. It is also possible to form an odd-electron ion from an ESI-generated multiply charged even-electron ion precursor with methods of electron capture dissociation (ECD) or electron transfer dissociation (ETD) which nowadays have widely-used application in sequencing of peptides and other biomolecule"

#EXERCISE 4.2.2: What would you suggest for a more comprehensive characterization instead? How would you suggest to improve the preprint?

The pre-print and related study can be improved by incorporating into the experimental design more appropriate selection of solvents (polar, non-polar) and expanding separation strategies to include those based on a multitude of properties (size, hydro-, hydrophilicity, relative volatility, negative and positive charge, solublity, affinity, color. This pre-print study can also be improved by furthering the current integratation of analysis of lipophilic compounds by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC)/MS with analysis of water-soluble compounds by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)/MS to improve coverage, Method optimization and selection of the most optimal instrumentation platforms and ionization modes can also exapand coverage and detection limits.A reference-data-driven analysis to match metabolomics tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)data against metadata-annotated source data as a pseudo-MS/MS reference library has been proposed to incease the low 10 % annotation rate of human untargeted metabolomics studies. This appraoch can be applied to this current study, as it has been demonstrated to increase MS/MS spectral usage 5.1-fold over conventional structural MS/MS library matches and allows empirical assessment of dietary patterns from untargeted data. EnviPat::check_chemform() tools can be used to get closer to level 2 confidence when comparing spectra with background of similar empirical isotopic distributions informs  The study and the metabolic community can be bolstered by gradually overcoming challenges associated with with MS/MS data interpretation, database content, isomer resolution, identification confidence, and FDR estimation.Specifically, and inceasing the number of 
Validations of retention times and MS/MS fragmentation data with a reference standards.
